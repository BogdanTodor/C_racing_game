# C_racing_game
This project aimed to integrate embedded C code with a microcontroller to effectively mimick a gameboy device with a built in game. 

From this project I learnt how to:
* Effectively write C code that is optimised for use on a microcontroller.
* Manage memory effectively.
* Program hardware functionality such as ADC's, buttons, switches etc in C.
* Learnt the fundamentals of programming at a low level and a result built a stronger understanding of higher level programming   languages.

NOTE: Some of the functionality implemented required the use of University built libraries. For copyright reasons, I am unable to share those files.
