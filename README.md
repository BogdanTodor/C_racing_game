# **C racing game **

### **What I learnt:**

From this project I learnt how to:
* Learnt how to incorporate elements of OOP into a C program.
* Manage memory effectively.
* Learnt the fundamentals of programming at a low level and a result built a stronger understanding of higher level programming   languages.

### **Project details:**

This project utilises C code to construct a zombie racing game in the terminal. Features involved bounding box collision, a headsup display for the player, realistic acceleration and breaking systems, varying speed limit surfaces to drive on, a fuel management system and an increasing number of obstacles as the game progressed. 


NOTE: Some of the functionality implemented required the use of University built libraries. For copyright reasons, I am unable to share those files.
